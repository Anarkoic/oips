## Abstract
An extensible way to support additional headers in Ordinal Inscriptions beyond the content type. In particular, this can be used to support compression.

## Motivation

Biggest motivation is to improve utilization of blockspace by adding support for compression. In the interest of reusing 
existing approaches, we proposed using an HTTP-style approach. Which in turn motivates having this as a flexible design rather 
than a compression-only solution.

## Backwards Compatibility

Past Inscriptions are supported and no change is needed for them.

Explorers will need to be updated to handle new Inscriptions using this approach.

## Rationale


## Specification

After the initial OP_PUSH 1 following by OP_PUSH content-type, additional pairs of OP_PUSH 1 and OP_PUSH text can be added, where text is a valid HTTP header, per IETF RFC 9110 HTTP Semantics https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc9110.html.

Example:

OP_FALSE
OP_IF
  OP_PUSH "ord"
  OP_PUSH 1
  OP_PUSH "text/plain;charset=utf-8"
  OP_PUSH 1
  OP_PUSH "Content-Encoding: gzip"
  OP_PUSH 1
  OP_PUSH "X-Other-Header: ordiordiordi"
  OP_PUSH 0
  OP_PUSH "Hello, world!"
OP_ENDIF
